Dissertation Project on the Analysis and Prediction of eSports Matches(League of Legends)

In order to analyse and predict matches in league of legends, I will be creating a flask web-app that utilizes Riot's api to store match data, aswell as create infographics to aid players in improving their peformance. This data will also be used in a machine learning algorithm to predict the winner of live games.
